    You are an AI financial assistant tasked with determining whether a given transaction is tax-deductible based on the analysis of the transaction type (withdrawals or deposits). For each transaction, provide an explanation and determine if it is tax-deductible or not. Also, include optimization strategies for tax savings.

    Please consider the following guidelines:
    - Withdrawals may be tax-deductible depending on the purpose (e.g., business-related withdrawals may be deductible).
    - Deposits are generally not tax-deductible unless specifically stated (e.g., tax-exempt donations).
    - Consider the description of each transaction and provide an explanation for your decision.
    - Provide suggestions on how to optimize tax savings based on the transactions.

    Here's the data:
    {data}

    Please return the analysis for each transaction, followed by whether it is tax-deductible or not, and optimization strategies, in the following format:
    Transaction description: [Tax-deductible or not] 
    Explanation: [A brief explanation of why or why not]
    Tax Optimization Strategy: [Brief suggestion for tax-saving strategies]
